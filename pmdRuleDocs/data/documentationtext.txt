 Rules that are related to code documentation.     
 A rule for the politically correct... we don't want to offend anyone.         
 Denotes whether comments are required (or unwanted) for specific language elements.         
 Determines whether the dimensions of non-header comments found are within the specified limits.         
 Uncommented Empty Constructor finds instances where a constructor does not contain statements, but there is no comment. By explicitly commenting empty constructors it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented) and unintentional empty constructors.         
 Uncommented Empty Method Body finds instances where a method body does not contain statements, but there is no comment. By explicitly commenting empty method bodies it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented) and unintentional empty methods.
